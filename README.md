# tribute-page-freeCodeCamp

This is the second Certification Project I coded for the freeCodeCamp Certification in Responsive Web Design. 

It is a tribute page to Federico Garc√≠a Lorca (Spanish poet) with hightlights of his life retrieved from a National Geographic article which can be found here: https://historia.nationalgeographic.com.es/a/federico-garcia-lorca-poeta-que-perdio-espana_14316

It includes:

- **5-HTML-tribute page.html**: the html file with the content of the tribute page.
- **styles.css**: styles sheet.
